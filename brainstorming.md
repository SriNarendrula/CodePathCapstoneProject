Step 1: Ideas

1: Random Quote/Fact Generator: Tap a button to display a random quote or fact from a small predefined list.

2: Mood Logger: Let users pick their current mood from 3–5 emoji options and log the time. Store entries using UserDefaults or a simple local DB.

3: Random Restaurant Picker Nearby: Scroll a list of nearby restaurants or press a button that picks a random restaurant out of that list

Step 2: Evaluating App Ideas

    Step 2.1: The Top Two
    1 and 3 are interesting to me

Step 2.2: Evaluating Ideas

Mood Logger
Mobile	✅ Leverages device UI well (emoji input), could add haptics or local notifications. Not just a web form.
Story	✅ Mental health tracking is a relatable and growing concern. Users understand the value quickly.
Market	➖ Decent niche (journaling, mental wellness), but not huge. Easy to imagine a specific audience.
Habit	✅ Designed for quick daily check-ins—can be a routine/habit-forming app.
Scope	✅ Very doable in an hour. Stripped-down version is still useful.


Random Restaurant Picker Nearby
Mobile	✅ Very mobile-centric. Uses location services, potentially maps, real-time data. This isn’t something a web page can do well.
Story	✅ Everyone knows the "Where should we eat?" struggle. Solves a common decision-fatigue problem in a fun way. Easy to demo to friends.
Market	✅ Broad appeal—anyone who eats out, especially indecisive people or friend groups. Could even be localized (e.g., campus food, vegan spots).
Habit	➖ Used occasionally, not daily. It’s more like a utility than a habit app, but it could be reused weekly.
Scope	✅ Basic version (get location + list restaurants + random pick button) is very buildable. Can scale with features like filters or ratings.

Step 2.3: The Final Decision
I'll choose Random Restaurant Picker Nearby
